# note-app-Backend
This is the backend server for the NoteVault application, built using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It is responsible for handling core functionalities like user authentication via Email OTP or Google Sign-In, generating and validating JWT tokens for secure access, and managing user-created notes. The backend can be configured to use either MongoDB or PostgreSQL as its database, depending on the setup. To get started, you need to install all required dependencies using npm install. Then, create a .env file in the root directory and define necessary environment variables such as PORT, DB_URL for your database connection string, and JWT_SECRET for token encryption. After this, you can run the development server using npm run dev, or build and run the production version with npm run build followed by npm run start. Once deployed (for example, on Render), your backend will be accessible via a public URL like https://your-backend-name.onrender.com, which can be used in the frontend as the API base URL.
